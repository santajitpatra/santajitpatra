          Like most website operators, Santajit patra collects
          non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
          and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
          language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
          visitor request. Santajit patra's purpose in collecting non-personally
          identifying information is to better understand how Santajit patra's
          visitors use its website. From time to time, Santajit patra may
          release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g.,
          by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Santajit patra also collects potentially personally-identifying
          information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users
          and for users leaving comments on https://santajitpatra.netlify.app/
          blog posts. Santajit patra only discloses logged in user and commenter
          IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
          personally-identifying information as described below.
